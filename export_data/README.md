# secuTrial data export

During the course of a clinical trial or at its conclusion data commonly needs to
be exported from secuTrial. This can be performed with the ExportSearchTool.

```
 Note: Your user account's role needs to be enabled 
       for exporting (AdminTool).
```

1. ExportSearchTool
2. Click "Export"
3. Configure the export according to your needs (example in screenshot below; note that exporting the audit trail can slow down the export dramatically). It is often desirable to select "Store reference values" \[in a\] "separate table" (particularly for statisticians)

4. "Start Export"
5. Save your TAN
6. Click "Export completed"
7. Enter your TAN and "Submit TAN"
8. Save your export locally

```
 Note: You can reuse an old export configuration if you 
       click "Export history" or "Download" and then 
       click the circled arrow for the export that you 
       would like to repeat. The export will be supplied 
       with the current data.
```
